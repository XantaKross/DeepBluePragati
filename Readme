If and when we have to reset the database perhaps due to data corruption or most likely password forgetting here are the steps to follow:
1. reconfigure mysql through installer and reset password. Or reinstall mysql entirely. Thus resetting the password.
NOTE: This will delete all previous memory and database schema.
2. delete all migrations, mainly the one in databaseAPI.
3. run cmd "python manage.py migrate databaseAPI zero"
4. run cmd "python manage.py makemigrations databaseAPI"
5. run cmd "python manage.py migrate databaseAPI"
6. You are done.
